1.) 

2a.)A continuous input the player makes during the game is moving the avatar around the map using the arrow keys. A discrete input is how when the character presses the space bar they jump and fall to the ground while still being able to maneuver left and right.

2b.) For the player to move to the next level they either have to get hit by a snowflake or fall through one of the holes in the map which promptly ends the level.

2c.) Each new level introduces more projectiles into the level the player will have to dodge 

2d.) In between each level is a summary that gives some stats about the previous level such as number of jumps made.


3.) The platforms and the character itself came from an example demo in the phaser arcade. The rest of the assets were found from the web to create a somewhat visually appealing experience.
